# About

Among the strongest communication tools we yield as educators are our grading systems and assessments. Grades serve as a standardized tool by which we emphasize what material is most vital in our courses. Both students and external parties utilize grades to understand students’ mastery of the course learning outcomes and personal achievement. However, recent research suggests that grading’s perceived benefits are less potent than we might believe, and traditional grading systems perpetuate inequity in our classrooms. 

In this project, we promote the development of alternative grading techniques, including mastery-based grading, specifications-based grading, and “ungrading” at ACM institutions. Through a virtual spring reading group and summer workshop, participants in this project will craft grading systems and assessments based on these alternative grading techniques tailored to their specific courses. In the fall, participants will support each other through a virtual alternative grading cohort as they deploy their systems and wrestle with the practical realities of alternative grading systems. Throughout, we will also help participants develop the necessary knowledge and tools to promote alternative grading in their institutions. Finally, we will also make publicly available the alternative systems and assessments developed throughout this project to further encourage ACM members to adopt these practices.
